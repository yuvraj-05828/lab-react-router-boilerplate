### Learning Goals:

The aim of this lab is to understand how can we navigate into different pages, using routers.

**NOTE:** Keep in mind the structure of your application as well. Try to create different components for each page.
For eg: you can create a component as `About.js` --> where you write the logic for the about page, and similarly for other pages. --> this will help you to organize your application structure.

***Do not forget to use the following command: `npm install react-router-dom` inorder to use router's.***

### Steps to follow:

1. create a new react project -> using the following command: `npx create-react-app router-lab`.
2. You have to make a navbar as shown below:

As you can see, that ->

1. If we click on Contacts --> we are directed to contacts page.
2. If we click on About --> we are directed to About's page.
3. If we click on the name of the site (Kalvium) --> we are directed to the Home page.

You have to achieve the same, using router's.

Happy Coding ❤️!
